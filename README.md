# Lambda Hubs Web API

Guided project for **Node API 1** Module.

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and cover the basics of `server-side routing` and using global `middleware`.

The code for the guided project will be written in a single file for simplicity. We'll see ways to structure an API to make it more maintainable in upcoming lectures.

## Prerequisites

- a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies. This step is equivalent to using `yarn` for React Projects.

Please follow along as the instructor builds the API step by step.

## What is Node js
- Node js is a javascript outside of the browser. It allows a developer to create server software in Javascript instead of C++. With it web and web apps can be created, start to finish, with the same language. Super cool. Another advantage is that Javascript runs line by line. It handles one task at a time, and so, it can not take advantage of multi cores. One does not have to worry about making the code crazy complex! Plus, you can utilize the new async features to take full advantage of the single core cpu process. Finally, kinda like a side, candy topping that you forget because the product is already so awesome, is NPM! NPM! NPM with an endless bucket of tools! So many tools that you will never use them all. Yep, that is a challange.

## What is Express js
- Express makes using node tons easier. Express is a module for node and allows you to write lots of code in just a few lines. You can write single page applications, restful api's, or serve up nearly anything you want to like images, pdf, etc. Writing server code and writing end points is made a breeze with express. With express, writing functions for middleware, routing, helpers or views is made simplier.
